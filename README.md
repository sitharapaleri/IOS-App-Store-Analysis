# IOS-App-Store-Analysis -  Analysing Unstructured Data
The purpose of this project is about analyzing the data for the Apple iOS app store and creating a new wireframe for 
the web page to display the analytics matrix based on our analysis on the available dataset. 
I am performing analysis on the dataset using MongoDB, Neo4j and SAS.
I have also analyzed the Apple iOS app store to visualize a pseudo schema for MongoDB and a graph model for Neo4j. 
My project includes the design based on our understanding of the Apple iOS app store and from the dataset. 
I ran various queries on MongoDB and Neo4j in order to analyze the dataset in detail and used MongoDB and Neo4j to perform 
some analytical analysis over data to include various metrics on the webpage wireframe that I designed.
